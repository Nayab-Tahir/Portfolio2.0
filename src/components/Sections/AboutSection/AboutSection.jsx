              â€¦I'm an aspiring software engineer with a strong foundation in
              C++, Java, Python, React, and a deep passion for data science.
              I've contributed to diverse projects, including a Java-based
              DocAppointmentPortal, an Android app called QuranApp, and a
              comprehensive MERN stack project, Tameer.pk, for my final year.
              I've enhanced my skills through Coursera. I'm a
              problem solver, creative thinker, and eager collaborator, always
              seeking innovations;
